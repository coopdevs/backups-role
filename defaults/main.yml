# FIXME This is ugly. We should instead put all commands inside
# the backups script template so that we can treat it all as a unit
# This comes handy to pipe all output to same file using restic role.
# Also to have all command pipeline together. Makes little sense
# to have it half in a template and half in variables.
# commands to execute in sequence
