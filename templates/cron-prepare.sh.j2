{# jinja comment.
 Next non-comment line below should render to something like:
 for DB in "main" "secondary" "test"; do
 But a simple | join(' ') would render instead to:
 for DB in main secondary test; do
 Thus, we do join('" "'):
 for DB in main" "secondary" "test; do
 And add the missing double quotes as literals outside jinja's reach, like
 "{{ â€¦ }}"
